Live demo ✅

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages from the `public/` folder and will be available at:

https://184ladno.github.io/International-portal/

What I added:
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy_pages.yml`) that publishes the `public/` folder whenever you push to `main`.

Notes:
- After the first successful push to `main`, give GitHub Pages a minute to publish; the link above will work in **Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, and **Safari**.
- If you prefer an alternate host (Vercel or Netlify) or want a custom domain, tell me which and I'll add it.
